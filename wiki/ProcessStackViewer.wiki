#summary Live stack viewing of a running process

= Process list =

You can choose a process from the list:<br/>

Double click an item, or press the "Live view" button to view the stacks of the selected process.<br/>

But you can also start a profiling session by clicking the *[StartProfiling profile it]* button.<br/>
You can also inject the "asmprofiler.dll" (if the dll exists in the same directory) to start an *[AsmProfilerInstrumentingMode instrumenting profiling session]*.

= Live view =

Here you can view the stack of one of the threads of the selected process:<br/>

You can select a thread from list on the left side. You can enable an auto refresh, so the stack gets refreshed every second. <br/>
You can also try one of the alternative stack tracing modes (default mode uses stack frames, but stack can be unusable if a <br/>
process is very busy, due to changing stack contents, temporary variables and pointers, etc). <br/>
Other modes are:
  * raw stack walking (show all valid pointers, so lot of false positives)
  * Windows StackWalk64 API (also uses stack frames?)
