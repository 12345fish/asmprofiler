The results are grouped by module (.exe; .dll), unit, class + function, and line number.<br/>
If you select a function, then the child and parent calls are listed below.

If you select a thread in the list on the left side, then this thread is made *bold*. You can also hide or show the specific chart series by (un)checking the checkboxes.

(more charts will be added in future!)
