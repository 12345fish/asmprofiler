#summary AsmProfiler is a free and open source profiler for 32 bit Windows applications.

= Introduction =

AsmProfiler can profile your application to find bottlenecks in your code (for optimizations). It is a Windows profiler (Windows NT, 2000, XP and x86) and can profile
any function (dll, c++, delphi, ?) without changing the original code or even the need of the original code.

AsmProfiler consists of 2 parts:
  * Instrumenting mode: 
    For exact time measurement of any function call. <br/>
    - High memory usage and some overhead for each function call.<br/>
    + Every call is stored, so exact function tracing possible!
  * Sampling mode: 
    For easy "click-and-go" but coarse grained profiling.<br/>
    - Coarse grained, only maximum of 1000 samples (theoretical) is possible, so many small            function calls will be missed.<br/>
    + Low overhead (profiler app runs at normal speed)

The "instrumenting mode" is made first (as "proof of concept"). After some time, the "sampling mode" is made separately..<br/>
In the future, the "instrumenting mode" will be completely rebuild and integrated in the GUI of the "sampling mode".<br/>
So the "instrumenting mode" can have some rough edges...
