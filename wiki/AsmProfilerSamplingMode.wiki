= Sampling mode =

The *sampling mode* of the AsmProfiler is the easiest mode: you can profile any application with only some mouse clicks! No source code changes or recompilation needed.<br/>
This mode will take about 500 till 1000 samples of the running process, so it gives a rough view of what's going on, and which functions takes the most time.<br/>
To get more exact and detailed results, please use the *[AsmProfilerInstrumentingMode instrument mode]* afterwards.
