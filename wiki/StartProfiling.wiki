#summary New profiling session screen

= Profiling screen =

This is profiling session screen:<br/>

For now, you can only profile a running process. To start and profile a new process will be added in the future.

== Choose process ==

To select a process, press the *Select process* button. The next screen will popup:<br/>

Double click a process or select a process and press the *Profile it* button.

== Start profiling ==
After selecting a process, you can set some options and the *Start* button is enabled:<br/>

You can set 2 options:
  * *Sampling interval*: 
    * 1 or more: uses _Sleep(x)_ between 2 samples, so _Sleep(1)_ gives theoretical a maximum of 1000 samples per second.
    * 0: Continuous mode: uses _Sleep(0)_, so other threads with the same priority can do some work too, but will take continuous samples if other threads are idle. Actually a "nice" continuous mode.
    * -1: Continuous mode without _Sleep(x)_, so it will take continuous samples, regardless of other threads. 
_Note: use continuous sampling only on multi core and/or multi cpu systems!_
  * *Priority*: the priority of the sampling thread.
 
You can start profiling by pressing the *Start sampling* button.

_Note: prepare the action you want to profile in the selected process before you *start sampling*, so you get the "cleanest" profiling as possible (without other disturbing function calls)._

== Stop profiling & view results ==
During the profiling session, you can only press the *Stop sampling* button:<br/>

You can also see some statistics:
  * Number of *samples take*
  * The actual *sample rate* (note we did not get our desired 1000 samples! This due to Windows...)
  * The *actual interval* (future, in our case about 2ms instead 1ms)

After you are done with your specific action, you can stop the profiler by pressing the * Stop sampling* button.<br/>
The *Show results* button will become enabled:

Press the *Show results* button to view the results of the profiling session.<br/>
This will show the *[ViewProfilingResults Sampling Results]* popup.
