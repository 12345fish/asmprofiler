#summary Short description how to get started with the *instrumenting* profiler

= Getting started with the *instrumenting* profiler =

This document will explain the 2 ways how to use the *instrumenting* profiler.

= Delphi, with source code, part 1 =

When you have a Delphi project (with all source code):
  * Delphi -> Project Options:
    * Linker -> Map file = detailed
    * Compiler -> Optimization = off
    * Compiler -> Stack frames = on
  * Add the following file to your project:
    *     [http://code.google.com/p/asmprofiler/source/browse/trunk/DllVersion/_uAsmProfDllLoader.pas _uAsmProfDllLoader.pas]
  * Add this line of code: 
  {{{if LoadProfilerDll then ShowProfileForm;}}}
  * Compile and Run!
  * Read HowtoUseTheProfiler start profiling

Demo source of .dpr:

{{{
program DllTestApp;

uses
  Forms,
  Unit1 in 'Unit1.pas' {Form1},
  _uAsmProfDllLoader in '..\DllVersion\_uAsmProfDllLoader.pas';

{$R *.res}

begin
  Application.Initialize;

  if LoadProfilerDll then
    ShowProfileForm;

  Application.CreateForm(TForm1, Form1);
  Application.Run;
end.
}}}

= Any executable =

When you only have an exeutable:
  * Start your executable
  * Start "dllinject.exe" (ignore possible virus warning)
  * Get the PID of your executable via Windows Task Manager or Process Exlorer
  * Enter this number in the black command line box of dllinject
  * Read HowtoUseTheProfiler start profiling
