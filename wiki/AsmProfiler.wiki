#summary Some explanations...

=Why this name?=

AsmProfiler stands for "assembly profiler" because the heart of the profiler is written in assembly.

=Why another profiler?=

There are some (good) profilers available, but these are:
  * Too expensive, and I want that every programmer can use a profiler
  * Too bloated, some profilers I know was so bloated I didn't knew what to do...
  * Misses some functionality, for example I wanted exact function call logging (even if that uses lots of memory) and I wanted nice charts :-)
